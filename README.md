### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
For almost twenty years, I have served as a system administrator and operational support officer for various departments of Eurobank, the leader of
retail banking in Greece.In the last 2 years I am focusing on Azure Cloud Platform as an engineer and also as a consultant trying to promote the importance and capabilities
of Cloud technologies.
I also share my endeavors here on Github but also on my personal blog and my goal is to build successful Azure Projects and ofcourse to contribute to the community.
I currently hold a number of MS Azure certifications and my current role is DevOps & Cloud Engineer at Capgemini, one of the global Consulting companies in the world.
In the last 2 years I live in the Netherlands,The Hague, enjoying anything that a beautiful city like The Hague can offer to someone who is always like to develop him/her self by any means!
