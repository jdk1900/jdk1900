### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
For almost twenty years, I have served as a system administrator and operational support officer for various departments of Eurobank, the leader of
retail banking in Greece.In the last 2 years I am focusing on Azure Cloud Platform as an engineer and also as a consultant trying to promote the importance and capabilities
of Cloud technologies.
I also share my endeavors here on Github but also on my personal blog and my goal is to build successful Azure Projects and ofcourse to contribute to the community.
I currently hold a number of MS Azure certifications and I am always eager to learn more and more.
